# Project Codewars - 7 kyu in Python

## Story

It cannot be stressed enough that you can learn to code only through practice.
There are numerous coding sites, but [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) is one
of the best because it's huge community, good assignment descriptions and
gamified progress support.

In this project we ask you to practice your coding skills on Codewars and get
better!

## What are you going to learn?

You will learn and practice how to do the following things in Python:
- variables,
- functions,
- loops and conditionals,
- iterables and sequences,
- strings,
- running tests,
- and using an online coding platform.

## Tasks

1. Reach 7kyu in Python on the Codewars coding platform by solving katas.
    - The student has an account on the [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) coding platform
    - There is a screenshot about the students Codewars profile page (https://www.codewars.com/users/<username>) in the project's directory named as `screenshot.jpg`
    - Checking the student's profile page shows that the students has reached 7 (or less) kyu in Python

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- Try to solve 8kyu katas first. You can start with
  [this collection](https://www.codewars.com/collections/basic-python-1)
  or use the [search feature](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/python?q=&r%5B%5D=-8&beta=false).
- You can train yourself by random katas by using the `Your next challange...`
  box on your [dashboard](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard). If you want to try
  harder katas, choose `Rank Up`, if you want to solidify your knowledge at a given
  level, choose `Practice and Repeat` from the dropdown.
